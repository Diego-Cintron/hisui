# hisui
Hisui is a math coding language based on Python and inspired by Matlab. The language supports basic math, statements, 
dictionaries, matrices, arrays, shapes and vectors.

The language uses the sly library to help with the lexing, parsing and interpreting process. Since the language 
uses sly, sly.py is required. 

To install sly.py on this project please type the following on the project terminal:
pip3 install sly

To view the syntax, all available method and current supported objects, please view "Documentation.txt"
